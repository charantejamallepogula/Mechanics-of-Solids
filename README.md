> User gives input such as defining the bridge geometry (points and members), specifying applied loads, and identifying support types (roller and pin supports).
> Graphical Representation: The plot_truss() function generates a graphical representation of the solved truss, depicting member forces, applied loads, and support types for visualization and analysis.
> Output: The solver outputs member forces (in Newtons) and identifies whether they are in tension or compression using the member class functions.
